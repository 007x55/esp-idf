Migrate Windows Environment to ESP-IDF v5.0
===========================================

The MSYS/MinGW-based Windows environment support has been deprecated since ESP-IDF v4.0 and was entirely removed in v5.0. Please use :ref:`get-started-windows-tools-installer` to set up a compatible Windows environment. The options include Windows Command Line, Power Shell and the graphical user interface based on Eclipse IDE. In addition, a VS Code-based environment can be set up with the `supported plugin <https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension>`.
