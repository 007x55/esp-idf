Migrate System to ESP-IDF 5.0
==================================

Inter-Processor Call
-----------------------

IPC (Inter-Processor Call) component has been moved to ``esp_system``.

Thus, any project presenting a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file with the parameters ``PRIV_REQUIRES esp_ipc`` or ``REQUIRES esp_ipc``, should be modified to simply remove these options as ``esp_system`` component is included by default.

ESP Clock
---------

The old headers ``target/clk.h``, ``esp_clk.h`` have been removed.

Therefore, If you want to use the function with the prefix ``esp_clk`` please include ``esp_private/esp_clk.h`` instead.

Cache Error Interrupt
---------------------

The old headers ``target/cache_err_int.h`` have been removed. Please include ``cache_err_int.h`` directly.
